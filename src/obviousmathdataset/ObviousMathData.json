        "proof": "To prove that if a square matrix $A$ is invertible, then its determinant is non-zero, we start by recalling the definition of an invertible matrix. A square matrix $A$ of size $n \\times n$ is said to be invertible if there exists another matrix $B$ of the same size such that:\n\n\\[ AB = BA = I_n, \\]\n\nwhere $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\nThe determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ \\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B). \\]\n\nSince $AB = I_n$, it follows that:\n\n\\[ \\det(AB) = \\det(I_n) = 1. \\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[ \\det(A)\\det(B) = 1. \\]\n\nFor the product of two numbers to be 1, neither of the numbers can be zero. Therefore, $\\det(A) \\neq 0$ and $\\det(B) \\neq 0$.\n\nHence, if $A$ is invertible, its determinant must be non-zero. This completes the proof."

        "proof": "To prove this statement, we need to show two implications:\n\n1. If two vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) are linearly dependent, then one is a scalar multiple of the other.\n2. If one vector is a scalar multiple of the other, then the two vectors are linearly dependent.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Linear Dependence Implies Scalar Multiple:**\n\n   Let \\(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\) be two vectors. By definition, \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are linearly dependent if there exist scalars \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not both zero, such that:\n\n   \\[\n   a\\mathbf{u} + b\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\n   \\]\n\n   Without loss of generality, assume \\(b \\neq 0\\) (the case \\(a \\neq 0\\) is similar). Then we can solve for \\(\\mathbf{v}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   b\\mathbf{v} = -a\\mathbf{u} \\implies \\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{a}{b}\\mathbf{u}\n   \\]\n\n   This shows that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a scalar multiple of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\).\n\n2. **Scalar Multiple Implies Linear Dependence:**\n\n   Conversely, suppose \\(\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u}\\) for some scalar \\(c\\). We need to show that \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are linearly dependent. Consider the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{v} - c\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}\n   \\]\n\n   This can be rewritten as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{v} - c\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies 1\\cdot \\mathbf{v} + (-c)\\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}\n   \\]\n\n   Here, the scalars \\(1\\) and \\(-c\\) are not both zero, which satisfies the condition for linear dependence.\n\nThus, we have shown that two vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) are linearly dependent if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other."

        "proof": "To prove that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can use a geometric approach involving parallel lines.\n\nConsider a triangle $\\triangle ABC$. We want to show that the sum of the angles $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ$.\n\n1. Draw a line parallel to the side $BC$ of the triangle through the vertex $A$. Let this line intersect the extensions of sides $AB$ and $AC$ at points $D$ and $E$, respectively.\n\n2. Since $DE$ is parallel to $BC$, by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, we have:\n   - $\\angle DAB = \\angle ABC$ (alternate interior angles)\n   - $\\angle EAC = \\angle ACB$ (alternate interior angles)\n\n3. The angles $\\angle DAB$, $\\angle BAC$, and $\\angle EAC$ form a straight line at point $A$, so their sum is $180^\\circ$:\n   \\[\n   \\angle DAB + \\angle BAC + \\angle EAC = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. Substituting the equal angles from step 2, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\angle ABC + \\angle BAC + \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the interior angles of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is $180^\\circ$. This completes the proof."

        "proof": "To prove that the shortest distance between two points in a Euclidean plane is a straight line, we can use the concept of the triangle inequality.\n\nLet the two points be $A$ and $B$. Consider any other point $C$ that is not on the line segment $AB$. We need to show that the distance from $A$ to $B$ is less than the sum of the distances from $A$ to $C$ and from $C$ to $B$.\n\nThe triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. In the triangle $\\triangle ACB$, the triangle inequality gives us:\n\n\\[\nAC + CB \\geq AB\n\\]\n\nEquality holds if and only if $C$ lies on the line segment $AB$, meaning $C$ is collinear with $A$ and $B$ and lies between them. In this case, the path from $A$ to $B$ via $C$ is the same as the straight line from $A$ to $B$.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance between two points $A$ and $B$ in a Euclidean plane is the straight line segment connecting them."
